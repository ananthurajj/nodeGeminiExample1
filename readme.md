## 🌟 Node.js Gemini API Example

🚀 A simple Node.js project demonstrating the power of Google's Generative AI (Gemini 1.5) API! This example interacts with the Gemini model to generate responses, including jokes, stories, and more. Easily set up and run in just a few steps!

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

  ✅ Node.js installed (v20.x or higher recommended)

  ✅ API key for Google Generative AI (Gemini)
  

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananthurajj/nodeGeminiExample1.git
```

## Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nodeGeminiExample1
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash 
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key (🔒 Make sure to keep this secure!):

```bash 
API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the project using the following command:

```bash 
npm start
```

When you run the script, it will send a request to the Gemini API asking for a programming joke and display the response in the terminal. 🤖💬
